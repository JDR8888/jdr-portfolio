## Description

I'm Jake and this is the repo for my portfolio website. This portfolio was built using create-react-app; It uses material-ui components and styling with additional css for a smooth, consistent look throughout each page. The projects/porftolio section features a handful of some of my recent projects to showcase some of the technology I have been working with lately. The contact page uses form validation and allows visitors to the site to conveniently send a message to my email. Check out the site at the link below!

The deployed page is: https://jdr8888.github.io/jdr-portfolio/
